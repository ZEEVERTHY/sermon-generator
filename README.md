# AI-Powered Sermon Generator

An intelligent content generation platform that uses LLM APIs to create personalized sermons based on user-defined themes, scripture references, and contextual parameters.

## 🎯 Project Purpose
Built to explore prompt engineering, knowledge structuring, and iterative AI training—the same skills used in AI agent coaching for customer support operations.

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- **Prompt Design:** Crafted and refined prompts to guide LLM behavior and improve output relevance
- **Context Management:** Structured knowledge inputs to help the model understand user intent
- **Failure Analysis:** Identified edge cases where the model struggled and adjusted prompts accordingly
- **Iterative Improvement:** Implemented feedback loops to continuously improve generation quality

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Next.js / TypeScript
- LLM API Integration (OpenAI/Anthropic)
- Prisma ORM
- Prompt Engineering & Training

## 💡 Relevance to AI Support Operations
This project demonstrates the core skills required for AI agent coaching:
1. Analyzing AI responses for accuracy and relevance
2. Tuning prompts and parameters to improve performance
3. Structuring knowledge to guide model behavior
4. Identifying failure patterns and implementing fixes


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
